# Console File Manager

ConsoleFileManager is a cross-platform program designed to simplify managing files and directories.
Currently, the feature `editfile` is windows-specific, as it requires the use of notepad.exe. The plan is to replace the use of notepad with a custom-made text-editor, like nano for linux.

## Features

- **Create Files:** Create new text files.
- **Delete Files:** Remove files from your file system.
- **Edit Files:** Open and edit text files using Notepad.
- **View Files:** Display the content of text files.
- **Create Directories:** Create new directories or folders.
- **Copy Files:** Copy files from one location to another.
- **Move Files:** Move files from one location to another.
- **List Contents:** List files and subdirectories in a specified directory.
